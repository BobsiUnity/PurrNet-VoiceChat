# PurrNet Dissonance Integration
With this integration you can easily have the Dissonance voice chat system working with the PurrNet networking solution
## Getting started
Import it into your project with the GitUrl: 

``` 
https://github.com/BobsiUnity/PurrNet-VoiceChat.git?path=/Assets/PurrNet-Dissonance
```

This way you can just add it to your package manager and you're ready to go.

Setting it up in Unity is as easy as having PurrNet & Dissonance installed already and simply adding the PurrNetCommsNetwork component to your Dissonance manager iwth the DissonanceComms already on it.

Dissonance Comms should automatically initialize with the PurrNet comms and have things working from there.
